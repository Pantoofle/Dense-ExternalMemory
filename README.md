# Dense-ExternalMemory - MAIN Branch
Neural Network with Dense structure and external memory. Goal is to study the use of memory for NN facing complex tasks

# Work per branch
- lstm: a fully working straightforward network. Works on the test if number 
appeared in the previous sequence
- mem: Memory modification so that the vectors stored may have a size that the
size of the input
- dev: crash test. To delete

# Dependencies
`python 3.6`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

# Usage
For a new Network
```
python main.py
```

Or to load an existant network
```
python main.py load <path/to/network>
```
