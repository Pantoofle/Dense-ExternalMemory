# Dense-ExternalMemory - Dense Structure
Neural Network with Dense structure and external memory. Goal is to study the use of memory for NN facing complex tasks

Memory has shape `(mem_size, vector_size)`

# Dependencies
`python 3.6`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, `keras`

# Usage
For a new Network
```
python main.py
```

Or to load an existant network
```
python main.py load <path/to/network>
```
